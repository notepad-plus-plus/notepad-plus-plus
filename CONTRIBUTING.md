#Contributing

Your pull requests will be welcome; however, they may not be accepted for various reasons.

##Guidelines for pull requests:

1. Respect Notepad++ coding style.
2. Make a single change per commit.
3. Make your modification compact - don't reformat source code in your request. It makes code review more difficult.

In short: The easier the code review is, the better the chance your pull request has to get accepted.
