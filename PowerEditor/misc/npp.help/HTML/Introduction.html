<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This document
 is dedicated to the countless lost hours of both people having
to search for simple answers, and people having to answer questions
that shouldn't have to be asked in the first place. Documentation is
always hard to get, good documentation nearly impossible =].
<p>This
markup is based in the default appearance of Microsoft Windows. This
can be different on your own system, but the names (text) should always
the same. This is especially important on the screenshots. They are
only for reference, your appearance of Notepad++ can be quite different.

<p>All the images used in this helpfile assume the default settings.
If you change any of these settings, you'll have to look for the other
image instead, this is most noticable with the toolbar (the position of
images will always remain the same).
<p>Also,
when talking about the left and right mouse buttons, the logical left
and right is meant. These are the same as the physical left and right
mouse buttons in the case of a right-handed setup. However, if you
have a left-handed setup you will probably have the buttons swapped
so act accordingly. This means in general you do what you normally do
for most actions, Notepad++ mostly follows the standard Windows
application behavior.
<p>Likewise,
the layout is discussed as it is displayed in a left-to-right order. On
right-to-left systems (such as Hebrew) translated versions of Notepad++
can have the display order reversed, adjust accordingly as well.<p>This helpfile uses some markup to distinguish certain interface elements or interaction.
<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>
When an option from the menu can be selected (open the menu then select the option), it will look like this:<td><span class="menu_item">Menu-&gt;Option</span><br>where an arrow means 'Option' is in a submenu of 'Menu'
<tr><td>When a button in the GUI can be pressed, it will be marked like this:<td><span class="button">Button</span>
<tr><td>Checkboxes can be toggled in on or off mode and are marked like this:<td><span class="checkbox">Checkbox</span>
<tr><td>Radiobuttons
are like checkboxes, but in a single group of radiobuttons only one can
be selected. Radiobuttons are marked like this:<td><span class="radio">Radiobutton</span>
<tr><td>
Sometimes
labels are used in the GUI to describe an element when they cannot have
any text associated with them directly. Labels look like this:
<td><span class="label">Label</span>
<tr><td>Finally, when mouse or keyboard interaction is required, the buttons or keys to press are marked like this:
<td><span class="shortcut">Leftmousebutton</span>
