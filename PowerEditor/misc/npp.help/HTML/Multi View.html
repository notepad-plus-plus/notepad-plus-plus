<h1>Multi
View</h1>
<p>
<img style="width: 839px; height: 550px;" alt="" src="Images/Screenshots/multiview.png">
<p>You
can enable a secondary edit window in Notepad++ to be able to view
two documents at the same time (possibly the same). If used with the
same document, you can quickly compare two documents or make quick
changes in two places at the same time without having to scroll or
keep bookmarks.<p>
To
use Multi View, first activate the document that you want to view in
the other view. Then, you have two options:<br>Select <span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Move/Clone current document-&gt;Go to
another view</span>, this will move the document to the other view, closing
it in the first view.<p>
Select
<span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Move/Clone current document-&gt;Clone to another view</span>, this will clone the document into the
other view, linking the two. Any change in the first document will
automatically be forwarded to the second and vice versa. You can also
reach these command by right-clicking on the tab of a document and
selecting the command from the context menu.</font><br>Note that these options are also available by dragging a tab into an edit field, with the <span class="shortcut">Ctrl</span> depressed for cloning and not depressed for moving
<p>Once
you have Multi View enabled, you can control its layout. You can <span class="shortcut">drag</span>
the divider around using your mouse, or <span class="shortcut">click</span> on the small arrows on
the top and bottom to completely move it to the left or right.
<span class="shortcut">Rightclicking</span> on the divider shows a popup menu allowing you to
rotate the layout for a horizontal or vertical version.
<p>Although
you can view two documents at the same time, only one can be active
(have the focus). You can determine the active view by the tabbar if
you have the topline enabled (see <a href="Preferences.html#Global">Tab bar</a>). By default,
the active view has a darker color of orange than the inactive view.
Also, only the active view can have the caret. You can switch the
active view by selecting <span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Focus on other view</span>. The active
view determines what options are available from the menu or toolbar.
If the main view has all documents saved, but the secondary view has
modified tabs, you can only select the Save option if the
secondary view is active.
<p>If
you have the same document open in two views, they will share some
properties, but some of them can be modified independently. These
include:
<p><ul><li>Folding (but not line hiding).
</li><li>Zoom level;
</li><li>Scroll position;
</li><li>Cursor position;
</li><li>RTL modus (see <a href="RTL.html">RTL</a>)
</li><li>Line wrap modus
</li><li>Overtype mode
</li><li>Nonprintable characters rendering

</li></ul>

<p>
If
you open a new document or a file, it will do so in the currently
active view. Additionally, closing the last document of a view will
close that view if two views are visible (including moving the last
document of one view to the other).<p>

To
ease document comparison/navigation, you can enable scroll locking in
Multi View. When a lock is enabled, scrolling one view will
automatically scroll the other. The lock will attempt to keep the
current offset. This means if one view is scrolled 5 lines lower than
the other, the vertical scroll lock will keep this distance unless
this is not possible anymore. Is soon as it is possible it will
retain the offset again.
<p>To
enable horizontal scroll locking, select <span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Synchronize
Horizontal Scrolling</span> or press the&nbsp;<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/syncH.png">  button.<p>
To
enable vertical scroll locking, select <span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Synchronize Vertical
Scrolling</span> or press the  <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/syncV.png">&nbsp;button.
