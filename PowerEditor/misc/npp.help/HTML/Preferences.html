<h2><a name="New_Document_Open_Save_directory"></a>New
Document/Default directory
</h2>
<p>These
options change the way new documents are created and what the default
Open/Save directories will be.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>New document:
<span style="font-weight:normal;">
<ul><li>
<span class="label">Encoding</span>:</font>
Allows
to choose what encoding to use (see <a href="Encoding.html">Encoding</a>).
</li><li><span class="label">Format</span>:
Allows
to choose what end-of-line format to use (see <a href="Newline%20format.html">Newline Format</a>).
</li><li><span class="label">Default language</span>: defines which highlighter will be used for any newly created document.  The dropdown list mirrors the Language menu. However,
user defined languages and external languages cannot be selected.
</li></ul></span>
<dt>File
Open/Save Directory:
<dd>The File Open/Save Directory, or Default
Directory, controls what directory Notepad++ looks in when opening or
saving files. Please note that the Default
directory is not the same as the Current Directory (Working
Directory) Notepad++ uses. Do not make assumptions about Notepad++
Current Directory.
<ul><li><span class="radio">Follow
the current document</span> - If this option is selected, the default
directory will be the directory of the currently active file. If the
file is a new, unsaved document, this will be Notepad++' directory.
</li><li><span class="radio">Remember
the last operation directory</span> -  If this option is selected, the
default directory will initially be the directory Notepad++ was
started in (you can control this by adjusting the shortcut you use
for Notepad++) and only change when browsing for files (to open or
save a file).
</li><li><span class="radio">Custom</span>
- The default directory can be set to a fixed path. Browse for a
path or type it yourself. If the path is invalid, Notepad++'
directory will be used. You are allowed to use Environment Variables, using the $(<i>var-name</i>) syntax as usual.
</li></ul></dl>
<p>
<h2><a name="File_Association"></a>File
Association
</h2>
<p>You
can associate files with Notepad++ so opening those files will start
Notepad++. Select a type of file, then select the desired extension
and press the left arrow to associate the file. To add a custom type
of file, select customize, enter the extension and press the <span class="button">-&gt;</span> button.
To remove the association, select the extension to dissociate and
press the arrow next to the garbage can.
<p>

<h2><a name="Language_Menu"></a>Language Menu/Tab settings
</h2>You
can select the languages that are available from the <span class="menu_item">Language</span> menu. In
the <span class="label">Available Items</span> list are the languages that are currently
visible. To hide a language form the menu, select it and press the
<span class="button">-&gt;</span> button to put it in the <span class="label">Disabled Items</span> list. Add the
language again by selecting it from the <span class="label">Disabled Items</span></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> list and
pressing the <span class="button">&lt;-</span> button.</font>
<br>
The appearance of the Language menu can be further controlled by the <span class="checkbox">Make Language menu Compact</span> checkbox. When checked, languages whose names start by the same letter are grouped into a submenu, rather than being all lumped in the menu proper.
<p>
Tab settings can be adjusted on a per language basis. The right hand list has all built-in languages, as well as a topmost (Default) entry. The latter applies to all languages which don't have a custom setting, as well as to all user defined languages. The frame below allows adjusting tab settings for the selected language:
<ul><li><span class="label">Tab size</span> - Size in space characters of a tab character in the document.
</li><li><span class="checkbox">Replace
by space</span> - Checking this will cause any tabs added to be in the

setting.</li></ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="Print"></a>Print</h2>
<p>Use
these settings to adjust the layout and colors used when printing a
document, as well as the page header and footer text. This can be any regular string or a variable that will change depending on the printed document.
<p><ul><li>
<span class="checkbox">Print
line number</span> - If selected, linenumbers will be printed aswell.</li><li>
Colour
Option:
<ul><li><span class="radio">WYSIWYG</span>
- print colours exactly as they are on the screen.</font>
</li><li><span class="radio">Invert</span>
- This will print the document with the background color inverted
(white becomes black for instance, and v.v.) and the default
foreground color inverted. All other colors will remain the same.</font>
</li><li><span class="radio">Black
on white</span> - All text will be printed black and a white background.
</li><li><span class="radio">No
background color</span> - This will print all the text colored, but any
background colors (including the default color) will be printed
white.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<dl>
<dt>Variables

<span class="button">Add</span>. The name will automatically be escaped.
