<h1><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Tab
Bar:</font></h1>
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Each
view has (by default) its own tab bar. The tab bar allows you to
select between different documents, and arrange them. For the tab bar
configuration options, see <a href="Preferences.html#Global">Preferences</a>.</font>
The
tab bar shows for each file its name and a little icon indicating the
status of that file. A blue disk (<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/saved.png">) means the file is not modified
(or it is a new document). If the disk is red (<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/unsaved.png">) it means that the
file has been modified and these changes have not yet been saved. A
grey disk (<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/readonly.png">) means the file is marked as read-only and cannot be
modified (see <a href="Read-Only.html">Read-Only</a>).</font>
If
more tabs are visible than can be shown on the display, then:
<ul><li>If you did not enable multine tab bar from <a href="Preferences.html#Global">Preferences</a>, two small
arrows appear on the right, allowing you to scroll through the tabs
to find the correct one. And if there is some empty space, double clicking in that space will create a new document.
<li>If you did, then several rows of tabs will be visible.</ul></font>
The
active tab can show an orange line (enabled by default). If two views
are enabled (see <a href="Multi%20View.html">Multi View</a>), the tab with the darker shade of orange
is the active one.</font>
You
can control the colors the tab bar uses using the <a href="Styler%20Configurator.html#Active_tab_focused">Styler Configurator</a>.<p>You can reach the tab bar context menu by <span class="shortcut">rightclicking</span>
on a tab. This context menu allows quick access to certain commands for
managing your files, getting and setting file properties and moving
the tab to other views.</font></body></html>
