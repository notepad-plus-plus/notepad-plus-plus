    <h3>
       Scintilla Bugs
    </h3>
    <p>
       At the end of italics style runs characters can be chopped off. An example
       is using Verdana 12 point italics for strings makes an ending double quote
       half visible and an ending single quote invisible. This is hard to solve
       completely, may be better to avoid these situations by, for example,
       choosing a font like Times New Roman for strings. There is a specific kluge
       for the end of line which adds some room for italics but this does not
       work elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
       Dragging over bold text in some fonts will ripple because of the difference in
       size between drawing all of a string at once and drawing it in parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Automatic scrolling when text dragged near edge of window.

    <h3>
       GTK+ Version Bugs
    </h3>
    <h3>
       Scintilla To Do
    </h3>
    <p>
       Folding for languages that don't have it yet and good folding for languages
       that inherited poor folding from another languages folding code.
    </p>
    <p>
       Simple pattern based styling.
    </p>
    <p>
       Different height lines based upon tallest text on the line rather than on the tallest style
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
       Composition of lexing for mixed languages (such as ASP+ over COBOL) by
       combining lexers.
    </p>
    <p>
       Printing support on GTK+. Maybe Postscript output or use Gnome?
    </p>
    <p>
	Stream folding which could be used to fold up the contents of HTML elements.
    </p>
    <p>
	Persisting view state such as current folding into a stream or blob so it is easy
	to restore.
    </p>
    <p>
	Move line up and move line down keys or move selected lines up / down.
    </p>
    <p>
	Printing of highlight lines and folding margin.
    </p>
    <p>
	Flow diagrams inside editor similar to
	<a href="http://www.eng.auburn.edu/grasp/grasp_main.shtml">
	GRASP</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
	A VCL component wrapper around Scintilla so it can be used with Delphi or
	Borland C++ Builder.
	There is <a href="http://www.pnotepad.org/scintilla/">some work</a>
	on this available.
    </p>
    <p>
	Port to MacOS X.
    </p>
    <p>
	More lexers for other languages.
    </p>
    <p>
	Automatically calculated range for horizontal scrolling.
    </p>
    <p>
	Virtual space at the end of lines so the caret can be moved beyond the end
	of lines with the cursor keys. May also make rectangular operations easier
	to perform.
    </p>
    <h3>
	SciTE To Do
    </h3>
    <p>
	Good regular expression support through a plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
	Allow tools to transform the selection, performing an operation like
	indentation or sorting.
    </p>
    <p>
	Allow file name based selection on all properties rather than just a chosen few.
    </p>
    <p>
	Opening from and saving to FTP servers.
    </p>
    <p>
	Setting to fold away comments upon opening.
    </p>
    <p>
	User defined fold ranges.
    </p>
    <p>
	Silent mode that does not display any message boxes.
    </p>
    <h3>
	Features I am unlikely to do
    </h3>
    <p>
	These are features I don't like or don't think are important enough to work on.
	Implementations are welcome from others though.
    </p>
    <p>
	Automatically saving modified menu shortcuts on exit.
    </p>
    <p>
	Mouse wheel panning (press the mouse wheel and then move the mouse) on
	Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
	Adding options to the save dialog to save in a particular encoding or with a
	chosen line ending.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Directions
    </h3>
    <p>
       The main point of this development is Scintilla, and this is where most effort will
       go. SciTE will get new features, but only when they make my life easier - I am
       not intending to make it grow up to be a huge full-function IDE like Visual
       Cafe. The lines I've currently decided not to step over in SciTE are any sort of
       project facility and any configuration dialogs. SciTE for Windows now has a
       Director interface for communicating with a separate project manager
       application.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you are interested in contributing code, do not feel any need to make it cross
       platform.
      Just code it for your platform and I'll either reimplement for the other platform or
      ensure that there is no effect on the other platform.
