# Script to generate CaseConvert.cxx from Python's Unicode data
# Should be run rarely when a Python with a new version of Unicode data is available.
# Requires Python 3.3 or later
# Should not be run with old versions of Python.

# Current best approach divides case conversions into two cases:
# simple symmetric and complex.
# Simple symmetric is where a lower and upper case pair convert to each
# other and the folded form is the same as the lower case.
# There are 1006 symmetric pairs.
# These are further divided into ranges (stored as lower, upper, range length,
# range pitch and singletons (stored as lower, upper).
# Complex is for cases that don't fit the above: where there are multiple
# characters in one of the forms or fold is different to lower or
# lower(upper(x)) or upper(lower(x)) are not x. These are represented as UTF-8
# strings with original, folded, upper, and lower separated by '|'.
# There are 126 complex cases.
